1) Collection list is organised in a table view to provide a simple yet organised interface for the collections list.
The table view allows to be able to swipe to delete a collection and add a new collection via the "+" button in the top
right of the navigation bar. Such functionalities are provided in their most easiest and familiar forms of action.

Useful actionable items have been placed in the top navigation bar along with links to other views.

This design option groups functional items together whilst placing them in a consistent and recognisable location in the app.

/***

Clipping List Screen:

Search bar has been placed at the top as per the spec, however also coincides with the design choice mentioned above. i.e
grouping of actionable items in a specific and consistent location.

In addition, a familiar "+" icon is also placed in the same location as the "Collection" view however will allow a user to add
a new clipping to the current collection when clicked.


/***

View Clipping List Screen:
*

****/

When viewing a clipping, the information has been presented in a stacked format to provide maximum room for the information
and the image, whilst also aiming to improve legibility.

Information is intended to be hierarchical. The most important information at the top with supporting secondary information below.

The top right "trash" icon provides a universal symbol allowing the user to delete the current clipping.

This functionality can be used in addition with the swipe to delete functionality.


/***

*
New Clipping Screen
*
*
****/

The tools to create a new clipping have been presented in a new view controller. The ordering of elements in this view follow a similar
system in terms of ordering and layout. This similarity of hierarchy and order aims to achieve consistency and familiarity that is seen in the clipping detail view.

In addition, the stack view aims to guide users through the process of creating a new clipping. Each visual element leads visually to the next.
